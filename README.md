rudimentary configuration management tool

This is a very rudimentary configuration management tool. This tool can be used to configure servers for the production service of a simple PHP application. This tool is modeled after industry tools such as Puppet, Chef, Fabric and Ansible.

This is inspired from the this github blog(Rick-Houser/Server_Config) ,i wanted to re-write this differently and use perl and shell for more manageble and configurable.
